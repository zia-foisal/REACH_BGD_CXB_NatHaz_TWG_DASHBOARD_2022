# REACH_BGD_CXB_NatHaz_TWG_DASHBOARD_2022

This dashboard summarizes the current work of the Natural Hazard Risk Analysis Technical Working Group (NatHaz TWG), a specialized sub-group of the Information and Assessment Working Group (IMAWG). More specifically, it presents natural hazard products that are available and have been validated by the Sector Coordinators and the Heads of the Sub-Office Group (HOSOG). All agencies involved in camp planning and implementation are advised to use these products as part of their toolkits to strengthen informed risk reduction and mitigation activities.

Natural hazard mapping and risk analyses are not static activities. They are subject to change due to the constantly evolving situation, environment, and available information. The products under the coordination of NatHaz TWG reflect the status at the time of creation. Regular updates will be provided, depending on new findings and changing conditions. This report is meant as a living document. All actors are invited to proactively ensure they are using the latest information.

The NatHaz TWG summary report until June 2022 can be accessed via the following link: [Natural Hazards Technical Working Group, Coxâ€™s Bazar | June 2022](https://www.impact-repository.org/document/reach/d5a0cddf/NatHaz_TWG_Summary_Report__v14.pdf)
