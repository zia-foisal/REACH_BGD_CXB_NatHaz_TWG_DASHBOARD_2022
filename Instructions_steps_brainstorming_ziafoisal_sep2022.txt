This dashboard summarizes the current work of the Natural Hazard Risk Analysis Technical Working Group (NatHaz TWG), 
a specialized sub-group of the Information and Assessment Working Group (IMAWG). More specifically, 
it presents natural hazards products that are available and have been validated by the Sector Coordinators and the Heads of Sub-Office Group (HOSOG). 
All agencies involved with camp planning and implementation are advised 
to use them as part of their toolkits to strengthen informed risk reduction and mitigation activities. Natural hazards mapping and risk analyses are not static activities. They are subject to change due to the 
constantly evolving situation, environment and available information. The products under the coordination of 
NatHaz TWG reflect the current status at the time of creation. Regular updates will be provided, depending on 
new findings and changing conditions. This report is meant as a living document. All actors are invited to pro-
actively ensure they are using the latest information.
